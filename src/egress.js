/**
 * The lane's own egress: one switchable outlet every upstream request walks out
 * through.
 *
 * Three call sites make the requests the region gate and the per-IP pools see —
 * `postStreamed` and `getJson` in src/http.js, `detectEgress` in src/probe.js —
 * and all three used to be a bare `fetch`. This module keeps them on `fetch`
 * and moves the routing underneath: with an outlet configured, `egressFetch`
 * rewrites the call to a loopback relay it owns, and the relay opens the real
 * connection through the outlet. The call sites keep their bodies, headers,
 * signals and `redirect: 'error'` policy verbatim, so a proxied turn and a
 * direct one differ in exactly one thing: which socket leaves this machine.
 *
 * Two outlet shapes, one dialer:
 *
 *   - `client`   — an http/https/socks5 proxy address that already exists (the
 *                  user's own client, a LAN gateway). The plugin dials it.
 *   - `subscription` — the plugin spawns mihomo (Clash Verge's core, or any
 *                  mihomo/clash binary found on the machine) with a
 *                  proxy-provider pointing at the subscription URL and a
 *                  url-test group that re-measures every node every minute. The lowest-latency node wins, a 429 in the
 *                  health-check marks the node dead and takes it out of the
 *                  rotation, and the plugin only ever dials the local mixed
 *                  port — it never parses a vless/vmess/trojan URI itself.
 *
 * Why spawn rather than embed: the light route (parse `http(s)/socks5` entries
 * and dial them in-process) cannot express a vless-REALITY subscription at all,
 * and a 108-byte PROXY-style trick cannot either — the protocol work belongs to
 * a purpose-built binary that already does health scoring and group selection.
 * The plugin's job is the seam: config in, local port out, `egressFetch`
 * unchanged between modes.
 *
 * What happens when the outlet itself misbehaves is the other half of the job,
 * and it is a ladder, cheapest rung first (#82). A request that goes through
 * the relay and never reaches response headers is a *strike*: the host hears
 * about every one of them so it can step off the node that just failed, and a
 * fault-marked failure is replayed once over the direct path — a tunnel that
 * never opened cost the gateway nothing, so the replay spends no quota and the
 * turn gets an answer instead of a 502. Three strikes in a row bench the
 * outlet: requests leave direct from then on, and the first answer that comes
 * back through the relay ends the bench. Nothing here covers a response body
 * that dies mid-stream — the adapter already calls that a `STREAM_CUT`, and
 * the retry it leads to is what lands the next strike.
 *
 * Security notes that the settings route relies on:
 *
 *   - The relay binds `127.0.0.1` on an ephemeral port and is deliberately not
 *     an open proxy: every start mints a random key, `egressFetch` presents it,
 *     and any other caller — a neighbouring local process, a rebound page — is
 *     refused before a single dial. A keyed caller still needs an absolute
 *     http(s) target, and nothing else in the process rewrites.
 *   - The managed mihomo's mixed port is passworded (`authentication`) with a
 *     per-start credential the plugin is the only holder of, so the outlet
 *     cannot be borrowed by another process on this machine.
 *   - The subscription URL is a bearer credential: it is written to the mihomo
 *     config file (mode 0600-ish, inside the plugin's own data dir), never
 *     logged, and surfaced to the settings page as a hostname only.
 *   - `mihomoPath` comes from local settings, which the trust fence already
 *     gates the same way it gates every other write; there is no download step
 *     anywhere in this file.

 * a suspect rather than a verdict: it has no measured address of its own, so it
 * is sorted behind every exit from another region instead of being dropped. The
 * region is a guess about addressing, and with nothing else left one unmeasured
 * node is still worth one attempt.

 * the refusal and the outlet, is the only component that can force the
 * measurement and then pick an exit the lane has not just refused.
