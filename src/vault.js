/**
 * Sealed credential store for the co-paid lane.
 *
 * The lane's credential and its endpoint never appear anywhere in the package
 * in readable form. At rest they exist only as an AES-256-GCM seal (`src/vault-data.js`
 * and `src/vault-anchor.js`, both generated); the seal's key is not stored at
 * all — it is derived at unlock time from three masked shards split across those
 * two files, so no single shipped file, and no substring search over the package,
 * reconstructs anything.
 *
 * Derivation alone does not open the seal. Unlock runs only after the host gate
 * accepts the running process as one of the shells this lane is published for:
 * the Tauri shell (its home path, its bundled node, its profile argument), the
 * Electron shell (the kernel's own profile context), or a kernel-declared web
 * profile (`web` / `web-desktop` — issues #58/#59: the lane rides the plugin
 * process, so a web host speaks the same wire as a desktop one). Everywhere
 * else the lane is dark: no request, no listing, no roster entry, and no
 * ciphertext work.
 *
 * The plaintext lives for the length of one request build and is never written,
 * logged, cached, or echoed: callers receive the credential object, hand it to
 * the request builder, and drop it.
 *
 * @module src/vault.js

 * Tauri (DSHEAC AIO): the kernel is a bundled node.exe under the app's
 * `resources\node\`, launched with the `web-desktop` profile and a DSH_HOME
 * that lives under the app's own Roaming identifier. All three are read off
 * the live process; any one alone is forgeable, the trio is not a coincidence.
 *
 * Electron (DeepSeek Harness): the kernel runs with the app-managed `desktop`
 * profile — a profile name the CLI refuses to launch by design (apps/cli
 * rejects it as "managed exclusively by the Electron application"), provided
 * by the kernel's own profile context. The desktop host also stamps
 * `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1` on the kernel process at spawn, but Electron
 * scrubs that variable from process.env during startup — verified on a live
 * install — so it exists on the spawn line only and cannot be a gate
 * criterion; the kernel-provided profile name alone is authoritative.
 *
 * Web hosts (dsh web, the "Deepseek Harness EAC" desktop shell that reports
 * profile `web-desktop`): the kernel-declared profile context is the signal.
 * The lane's client is the plugin process itself, so a web composition speaks
 * the identical wire; what the gate keeps out are processes no DSH kernel is
 * running in — a profile context no kernel would mint.
 *
 * `profileName` comes from the kernel's own profile context service, read
 * opportunistically by the caller; older kernel lines may not provide it,
 * which the Tauri branch does not depend on.
