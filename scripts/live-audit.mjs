/**
 * After-publish audit: does an installed user actually get *this* release?
 *
 * `docs/RELEASING.md`'s purge step used to name only the two feed files, which
 * leaves a worse state than an unpurged CDN: the manifest goes fresh while the
 * files beside it stay on the previous commit, so every digest in a correct
 * manifest mismatches a stale byte. Measured on 2026-09-27 right after pushing
 * v1.3.1 — `…@main/index.js` answered 56 999 bytes (v1.3.0) against a manifest
 * declaring 60 224, while the same CDN under `@v1.3.1` and the commit sha both
 * answered 60 224. The upgrade fails safe (staging aborts, the old version stays
 * installed), but it fails.
 *
 * So the gate is the consumer's own path, not a curl of the manifest: download
 * the manifest from each source in order, stage every file the manifest names
 * with the plugin's own size-and-hash verification, and read it back. A source
 * that cannot be reached is reported as such — on the networks this plugin most
 * serves, `raw.githubusercontent.com` is the one that fails, which is exactly
 * why the jsDelivr leg has to be the one that proves it.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/live-audit.mjs [--source <url>]
